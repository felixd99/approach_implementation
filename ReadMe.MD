# Installation

TBD

# Run the application
There are three ways to run the application:

### 1. Running a single file manually

### 2. Running multiple files at once
To run multiples files at once, simply move them to the `Texts` folder and run the `evaluation.sh` Shell script.
Due to the nature of Python and spaCy, we need to run the python files separately and cannot simply call the function multiple times.
