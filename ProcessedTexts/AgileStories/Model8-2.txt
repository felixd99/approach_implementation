AS I
I WANT TO create a job description
WHEN a vacancy is reported to me

AS I
I WANT TO ask the Department
IF there is still confusion in the message

AS I
I WANT TO submit the job description
AFTER I created a job description

AS I
I WANT TO wait for the approval
AFTER I submitted the job description

AS I
I WANT TO EITHER happen that the department does not approve the job description ,
OR reject and

AS I
I WANT TO correct the description
AFTER I waited for the approval

AS I
I WANT TO submit But for consideration
AFTER I corrected the description

AS I
I WANT TO post the job
IF the description is finally approved
